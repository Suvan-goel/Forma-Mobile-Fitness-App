# Feedback Text-to-Speech

The app reads out form feedback messages during Barbell Curl sessions using the device's built-in text-to-speech (expo-speech).

## Behavior

- When you complete a Barbell Curl rep, form feedback (e.g. "Great rep!", "Flex more at the top of the curl.") is spoken aloud.
- TTS only plays when the feedback toggle is on (message icon to the right of the record button).
- Uses the device's default voice and works offline.
